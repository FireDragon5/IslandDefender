## Why I Created This Plugin

The inspiration behind developing the IslandDefender plugin comes from my own fond memories of playing on a server from the past, which has sadly been discontinued. The idea of that server left a lasting impression on me, and now I'm excited to recreate that experience with my unique twist. IslandDefender is the realization of this vision.
